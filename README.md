## Note:
Hot Potato was not designed with cross-content mod compatibility in mind. It is recommended to not play Hot Potato with other mods installed. If you forego this warning, expect things to break!!

***If you are experiencing a crash on startup,*** please be sure that your folders are not **nested**. If your Mod's folder looks like `Balatro/Mods/Hot-Potato/Hot-Potato/<mod files here>`, cut and paste the mod files from the second folder to the first, so that the mod's files are only one "layer" deep. The Mod's folder should look like this: `Balatro/Mods/Hot-Potato/<mod files here>`.

**If your mod folder looks correct and you are still experiencing crashes of any kind**, please create an issue on this repository, or send a crash log in the mod's [thread in the Balatro Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1397989781178155009).
